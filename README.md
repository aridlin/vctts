# VOICECHAT TTS

A lightweight Windows overlay that lets you type a short message and play it over **two output devices at once**.  
Designed for games and voice chat where you need **fast TTS** without touching your microphone.

## Features

- **Offline Windows TTS** using system voices (WinRT / SAPI).
  - Uses installed Windows voices (e.g. *Adam, Zira, David*, etc.).
  - Voice selectable from the config menu.
- **Optional online keyless TTS fallback** (StreamElements).
- **Translator mode** using an online translation pass before speech synthesis, with target-language voice preference.
- **Incoming app setup** with target executable and optional per-app mute while the listener pipeline is running.
- **Dual output device playback** (play to two speakers / virtual cables simultaneously).
- **Reliable keyboard input** (proper layout + dead-key handling via `WM_CHAR`).
- **Global hotkeys** for quick start/stop while in-game.
- **Custom Win32 UI backend** inspired by `ftui`, with painted controls and recording overlay.
- **No microphone interference** – pure playback.
